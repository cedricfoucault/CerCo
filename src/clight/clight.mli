type intsize = I8 | I16 | I32

type floatsize = F32 | F64

(** The syntax of type expressions.  Some points to note:
  - Array types [Tarray n] carry the size [n] of the array.
  Arrays with unknown sizes are represented by pointer types.
  - Function types [Tfunction targs tres] specify the number and types
  of the function arguments (list [targs]), and the type of the
  function result ([tres]).  Variadic functions and old-style unprototyped
  functions are not supported.
  - In C, struct and union types are named and compared by name.
  This enables the definition of recursive struct types such as
  {[
  struct s1 { int n; struct * s1 next; };
  ]}
  Note that recursion within types must go through a pointer type.
  For instance, the following is not allowed in C.
  {[
  struct s2 { int n; struct s2 next; };
  ]}
  In Clight, struct and union types [Tstruct id fields] and
  [Tunion id fields] are compared by structure: the [fields]
  argument gives the names and types of the members.  The AST_common.identifier
  [id] is a local name which can be used in conjuction with the
  [Tcomp_ptr] constructor to express recursive types.  [Tcomp_ptr id]
  stands for a pointer type to the nearest enclosing [Tstruct]
  or [Tunion] type named [id].  For instance. the structure [s1]
  defined above in C is expressed by
  {[
  Tstruct "s1" (Fcons "n" (Tint I32 Signed)
  (Fcons "next" (Tcomp_ptr "s1")
  Fnil))
  ]}
  Note that the incorrect structure [s2] above cannot be expressed at
  all, since [Tcomp_ptr] lets us refer to a pointer to an enclosing
  structure or union, but not to the structure or union directly.

(** Clight expressions are a large subset of those of C.
  The main omissions are string literals and assignment operators
  ([=], [+=], [++], etc).  In Clight, assignment is a statement,
  not an expression.  

  All expressions are annotated with their types.  An expression
  (type [expr]) is therefore a pair of a type and an expression
  description (type [expr_descr]).
